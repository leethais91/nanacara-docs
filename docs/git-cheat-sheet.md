#### GIT BASICS
|||
|-|-|
|`git init <directory>`|Create empty Git repo in specified directory. Run with no arguments to initialize the current directory as a git repository.|
|`git clone <repo>`|Clone repo located at `<repo>` onto local machine. Original repo can be located on the local filesystem or on a remote machine via HTTP or SSH.|
|`git config user.name <name>`|Define author name to be used for all commits in current repo. Devs commonly use --global flag to set config options for current user.|
|`git add <directory>`|Stage all changes in `<directory>` for the next commit. Replace `<directory>` with a `<file>` to change a specific file.|
|`git commit -m <message>`|Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use `<message>` as the commit message.|
|`git status`|List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked.|
|`git diff`|Show unstaged changes between your index and working directory|

---
#### UNDOING CHANGES
|||
|-|-|
|`git revert <commit>`|Create new commit that undoes all of the changes made in `<commit>`, then apply it to the current branch.|
|`git reset <file>`|Remove `<file>` from the staging area, but leave the working directory unchanged. This unstages a file without overwriting any changes.|
|`git clean -n`|Shows which files would be removed from working directory. Use the -f flag in place of the -n flag to execute the clean.|

---
#### REWRITING GIT HISTORY
|||
|-|-|
|`git commit --amend`|Replace the last commit with the staged changes and last commit combined. Use with nothing staged to edit the last commit’s message|
|`git rebase <base>`|Rebase the current branch onto `<base>`. `<base>` can be a commit ID, branch name, a tag, or a relative reference to HEAD.|
|`git reflog`|Show a log of changes to the local repository’s HEAD. Add `--relative-date` flag to show date info or `--all` to show all refs.|
---
#### GIT BRANCHES
|||
|-|-|
|`git branch`|List all of the branches in your repo. Add a `<branch>` argument to create a new branch with the name `<branch>`.|
|`git checkout -b <branch>`|Create and check out a new branch named `<branch>`. Drop the -b flag to checkout an existing branch.|
|`git merge <branch>`|Merge `<branch>` into the current branch.|
---
#### GIT CONFIG
|||
|-|-|
|`git config --global user.name <name>`|Define the author name to be used for all commits by the current user.|
|`git config --global user.email <email>`|Define the author email to be used for all commits by the current user.|
|`git config --global alias. <alias-name> <git-command>`|Create shortcut for a Git command. E.g. alias.glog `“log --graph--oneline”` will set `git glog` equivalent to `git log --graph --oneline`.|
|`git config --system core.editor <editor>`|Set text editor used by commands for all users on the machine. `<editor>` arg should be the command that launches the desired editor (e.g., vi, visualcode).|
|`git config --global --edit`|Open the global configuration file in a text editor for manual editing.|
---
#### GIT LOG
|||
|-|-|
|`git log -<limit>`|Limit number of commits by `<limit>`. E.g. `git log -5` will limit to 5 commits|
|`git log --oneline`|Condense each commit to a single line.|
|`git log -p`|Display the full diff of each commit.|
|`git log --stat`|Include which files were altered and the relative number of lines that were added or deleted from each of them.|
|`git log --author=”<pattern>”`|Search for commits by a particular author.|
|`git log --grep=”<pattern>”`|Search for commits with a commit message that matches `<pattern>`.|
|`git log <since>..<until>`|Show commits that occur between `<since>` and `<until>`. Args can be a commit ID, branch name, HEAD, or any other kind of revision reference.|
|`git log -- <file>`|Only display commits that have the specified file.|
|`git log --graph --decorate`|`--graph` flag draws a text based graph of commits on left side of commit msgs. `--decorate` adds names of branches or tags of commits shown.|
---
#### GIT RESET
|||
|-|-|
|`git reset`|Reset staging area to match most recent commit, but leave the working directory unchanged.|
|`git reset --hard`|Reset staging area and working directory to match most recent commit and **overwrites all changes** in the working directory.|
|`git reset <commit>`|Move the current branch tip backward to `<commit>`, reset the staging area to match, but leave the working directory alone.|
|`git reset --hard <commit>`|Same as previous, but resets both the staging area & working directory to match. Deletes uncommitted changes, and all commits after `<commit>`.|
---

#### GIT REBASE
|||
|-|-|
|`git rebase -i <base>`|Interactively rebase current branch onto `<base>`. Launches editor to enter commands for how each commit will be transferred to the new base.|
---
#### GIT PULL
|||
|-|-|
|`git pull --rebase <remote>`|Fetch the remote’s copy of current branch and rebases it into the local copy. Uses git rebase instead of merge to integrate the branches.|
---
#### GIT PUSH
|||
|-|-|
|`git push <remote> --force`|Forces the git push even if it results in a _non-fast-forward_ merge. Do not use the `--force` flag unless you’re absolutely sure you know what you’re doing|
|`git push <remote> --all`|Push all of your local branches to the specified remote.|
|`git push <remote> --tags`|Tags aren’t automatically pushed when you push a branch or use the `--all` flag. The `--tags` flag sends all of your local tags to the remote repo.|
